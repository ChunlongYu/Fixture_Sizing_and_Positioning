# Fixture_Sizing_and_Positioning
This is a repository for the paper "Optimizing Fixture Layout for Compliant Part Assembly: A Kriging-based Metaheuristic". We propose an efficient algorithm based on the large neighborhood search framework and the Kriging metamodel to optimize the fixture layout for compliant part assembly in the shipbuilding industry.
